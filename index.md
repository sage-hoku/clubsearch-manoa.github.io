# Find UH Club

## Problem

UH Manoa has many clubs available for students to join. There is no easy way for students to learn about all the different clubs and what, as well as how to join a particular club.

## Solution

A website that allows students to browse a list of clubs and get information on them. The website must also allow club admins that can change what there club page shows, as well as a super admins who can monitor the website for inappropriate content and make regular users into club admins.

The website should allow filtering of clubs by criteria ie: athletic, art, music.

Users should be able to specify interests and be notified when a club is created that has that interest.

Admins can monitor the website and create new interests.

## Development History

### [Milestone 1](https://github.com/orgs/dummy): Mockup
The goal of Milestone 1 was to create mockup pages of the website. Some of the key pages such as the landing, sign-in, home, and profile pages were drafted as HTML pages. We were also tasked with deploying our created landing page and creating a domain for our project. 

Here are our mockup pages for our Milestone 1:

This is our landing page (HTML):

This is our sign-in page (HTML):

This is our home page (HTML) which is displayed upon successful login. Note that the navigation bar depends on the user's role (regular user, club admin, or super admin):
